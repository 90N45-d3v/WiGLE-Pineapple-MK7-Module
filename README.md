# WiFi Pineapple MK7 Module: WiGLE

### The Official Repository for the WiGLE Pineapple Module
This module gives you the possibility to quickly collect information about access points by using the [WiGLE.net](https://wigle.net) DB and its API. A common use case could be to get the last positions/home of a target by simply searching for the SSID probed from his phone/laptop etc.

*As soon as my pull request is accepted, this module will be available in [Hak5's official module repository](https://github.com/hak5/pineapple-modules) and should be available for download directly from the web interface of the WiFi Pineapple.*

### Installation
1. Run `./build.sh` in the wigle directory
2. Upload the `dist/wigle` directory onto your WiFi Pineapple
